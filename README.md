# Angular Recipe Book
A web application developed using Angular 9 and Firebase incorporating various functionalities like selecting from a wide range of recipes, adding them to shopping cart, creating new recipes, searching for particular recipes. It depicts all the core concepts of angular ranging from event emitters, subjects and observables to routing/routing guards to signup/login and authentication using JWT.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
